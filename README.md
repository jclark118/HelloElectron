# HelloElectron
A very basic electron app which should be able to run locally, build a dmg, or build an rpm file using electron builder

To get started, run `npm install`.

To run locally, run `npm start`.

To build arm64 dmg for mac, run `npm run build:mac`.

To build x64 rpm for linux, run `npm run build:linux`.
